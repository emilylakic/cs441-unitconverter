## What It Does

Converts a user-inputed number between the units 'meters', 'centimeters', and 'inches' based on the user's choice. 

## Design Features

This app contains:
- 4x LinearLayout (3 horizontal, 1 vertical)
- 1x ImageView
- 1x EditText
- 4x TextView
- 2x Spinner
- 1x Button

## Functionality

EditText allows the user to enter a number of their choosing, including decimals. The user is prompted to choose between three units, 'meter', 'centimeter', and 'inch', in a dropdown menu, denoted as the first spinner in this program. A second TextView prompts the user to choose a unit from a second dropdown menu, the second spinner, to convert their inputted value to. A 'convert' button upon being clicked will then display the converted value in a TextView field below. The ImageView graphic was created in Adobe Photoshop.
